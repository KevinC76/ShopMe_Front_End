# My First Full-Stack MERN Project  

This project is my first full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). While it’s far from perfect, it has been an invaluable learning experience.  

## What I’ve Learned  
Through this project, I’ve explored and implemented several new concepts that I’ve always wanted to try, including:  
- ✅ Creating API routes  
- ✅ Connecting the frontend with the backend  
- ✅ Making API calls  
- ✅ Working with RESTful APIs  
- ✅ Implementing authentication by storing tokens in cookies  

## Future Goals  
There’s still so much to learn, but this project has shown me that I can keep growing and refining my skills. Moving forward, I aim to:  
- 🚀 Deepen my knowledge in full-stack development  
- ⚡ Explore state management solutions  
- 🏆 Learn widely used industry technologies  

I'm excited for what’s next on this journey!
