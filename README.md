#My First Full-Stack MERN Project
This project is my first full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). While it’s far from perfect, it has been an invaluable learning experience.

Through this project, I’ve explored and implemented several new concepts that I’ve always wanted to try, including:

Creating API routes

Connecting the frontend with the backend

Making API calls

Working with RESTful APIs

Implementing authentication by storing tokens in cookies

There’s still so much to learn, but this project has shown me that I can keep growing and refining my skills. Moving forward, I aim to deepen my knowledge in full-stack development, particularly in state management and widely used industry technologies.

I'm excited for what’s next on this journey! 🚀
